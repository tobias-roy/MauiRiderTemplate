## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error, try following these steps (replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your own username):

1. Download the **Command Line Tools** for Mac from [Android Studio Command Line Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
2. Extract the downloaded file to `/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools`.
3. Create a folder named `latest`.
   - This should have the path `/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest`
5. Move the files from `cmdline-tools` to the `latest` folder.

### Folder Structure After Extraction

You should now have the following structure:

```
/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest
/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
```

- If the `bin` folder doesnâ€™t exist, create it.

### JAVA Error

If you have encountered a JAVA error similair to this:
java -v 
	/Users/USERNAME/.asdf/shims/java: line 3: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/asdf/0.13.1/libexec/bin/asdf: 
	No such file or directory /Users/USERNAME/.asdf/shims/java: line 3: exec: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/asdf/0.13.1/libexec/bin/asdf: cannot execute: No such file or directory


Try running the following:
```
asdf reshim
```


### Accept SDK Licenses

1. Using the terminal, navigate to:

   ```bash
   cd /YOURUSERNAME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
   ```

2. Run the following command to accept the SDK licenses:

   ```bash
   yes | ./sdkmanager --licenses
   ```

3. Install the Android 34 API:

   ```bash
   ./sdkmanager "platforms;android-34"
   ```



### Final Step
You should now be able to build and run your project successfully.
